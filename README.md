# Suhba
Suhba is a digital sanctuary for the Muslim Ummah, bridging the gap between knowledge and belonging. We provide a 100-day personalized roadmap and the "Sakina" support system—a secure, anonymous peer-mentorship network for reverts. Our mission is to ensure no one walks the path of faith alone by combining tech-driven education with human empathy.
